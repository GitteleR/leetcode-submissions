ðŸ”¹ ^ â€” Start of String (or Line)
The caret (^) matches the position at the beginning of the string.

ex.
^a matches "a" in "abc" but not in "zabc".

^abc matches "abc" in "abcdef" but not in "zabcdef".

In multiline mode, ^ can also match the position after a newline character, effectively matching the start of each line within the string.

ðŸ”¹ $ â€” End of String (or Line)
The dollar sign ($) matches the position just before the end of the string.

Examples:

a$ matches "a" in "ba" but not in "ab".

abc$ matches "abc" in "zabc" but not in "zabcdef".

In multiline mode, $ can also match the position before a newline character, effectively matching the end of each line within the string.

ðŸ”¹ Combining ^ and $ â€” Exact Match
When used together, ^ and $ ensure that the entire string matches the pattern.

Example:

^abc$ matches "abc" but not "abc " or "zabc".

This combination is useful for validating that a string conforms exactly to a specific format.
